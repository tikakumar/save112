Project Name: Save 112!


Project Description: The goal is to go from “your dorm”, the starting point of the maze, into “112 lecture”, in order to save 112. The maze has these coins that you need to eat (the number depending on the level of difficulty) in order to unlock the “112 lecture hall”. Finally there are enemy(s) that approach your player and if they reach you, your score gets dropped by ½ and you have to eat double the coins to unlock the lecture. If you have half the required amount of coins, you can “buy” a power up and cause an enemy to move in another random location. If you manage to eat enough coins to unlock the end of the maze and get there, you save 112!


In order to run the project, you should run the file “tp3.py” which should be in a provided folder filled with a cmu_graphics folder, a 112.png image, and a cmu_cs3_graphics.py file. 


There are no libraries necessary to play!!


The shortcut commands not already mentioned in the “directions” section of the game are:
Pressing the key “h”: allows you to increase your score and therefore brings the amount of coins necessary to unlock the end down
Pressing the key “e”: allows you to get to the end screen of the game without actually completing the game
Pressing the key “f” twice: after you are in the end stage will allow a secret surprise to pop up
Pressing the key “5”: after you are in the end stage with the first surprise will allow the final end screen to pop up
